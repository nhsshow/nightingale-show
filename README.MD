# NHSScotland WordPress Theme
This is a companion child theme that can be used in conjuction with the NHS Leadership Academy Nightingale Theme (https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/nightingale/).  
It has been customised to apply NHS Scotland colours, add additional custom templates, and change the font used (due to licensing).
